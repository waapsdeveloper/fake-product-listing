## Project Structure

The project follows Angular's component-based architecture. Below is an overview of the main folders and files:

- **src/app/components/**: Contains all the reusable components used in the application (e.g., product listing, search bar, filter, etc.).
- **src/app/services/**: Contains services for API integration and state management.
- **src/app/pages/**: Contains the main page component for the product listing.

## Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for the base styling and responsiveness.
- **Custom CSS**: Additional custom styles are applied to achieve a more refined and fair layout.

## Assumptions

- The application assumes that all API endpoints provided are functional and return the expected data.
- The filtering options are based on predefined categories, price ranges, and availability status.

## Limitations

- **No Bonus Features**: The following optional features were not implemented:
  - Grid/List view toggle.
  - Light/Dark mode toggle.
  - Unit testing for components.
  - Pagination.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling mechanisms are in place, but further enhancements could be made.

## API Endpoints

The application uses the following endpoints from the FakeStoreAPI:

- Get All Products: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`
- Get Products by Category: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/category/{category}`
- Get Single Product: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/{id}`
